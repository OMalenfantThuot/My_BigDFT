    "- and finally, the desired output can be computed from the results of the calculations. \n",

    "The goal of the `AbstractWorkflow` class is to ease the implementation of this type of workflow in a class that is meant to be general, *i.e.*, that can be applicable to a large class of systems, using a large set of possible input parameters. Such a class is meant to be used simply by:\n",

    "\n",
    "The use of the `Workflow` class in the previous notebook showed you that having a clear separation of the initialization and post-processing of a workflow is important, notably to reduce the amount of code to copy and paste each time you want to change the system or the input parameters. We will go even further in that direction by writing a class deriving from the `AbstractWorkflow` class. You will see that the code you implemented in the previous exercise can be quickly adapted to meet our needs here.\n",

    "- define the `post_proc` method to compute the value of the `pol_tensor` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method has `ground_state` as argument, which is meant to be a `Job` instance of the reference ground state. This job must be the first one in the queue. The three other jobs must be added by taking this one job as reference, only modifying the run directory (in the same manner as in the previous exercise) and the input parameters, so as to apply an electric field in each direction ($x$, $y$ and $z$). To that end, you must add an optional argument `ef_amplitude` to the `__init__` method to state the value of the electric field amplitude to be used in all the jobs (default value: `1.e-4`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the `pol_tensor` method is given so as to give you an example of how to actually code such methods. Note the use of a `_poltensor` attribute in that method and in the `post_proc` method; this is what we meant by \"semi-private attributes\" in the previous section: defining a property returning such a semi-private attribute ensures that you can access the `pol_tensor` attribute here, but it cannot be set. The only way of modifying the value of this attribute is to change the value of the `_poltensor`. This is actually what is done in the `post_proc` method!"
