    "\n",
    "You could add the possibility to perform two BigDFT calculations per space coordinates in order to get more accurate results, while removing the reference job without any electric field. This means that 6 jobs must be run instead of 4: two per space coordinate - one with a positive electric field amplitude, the other with a negative one. This is especially relevant when the system under consideration has no dipole: BigDFT would still find a residual dipole, that might be large enough to give messy results (depending on the required accuracy). This can be tedious (it is but a variation of the present exercise), and you might want to use the same scheme as above: first use the Workflow class, and then implement that into the the ``PolTensor`` class. The difficulty is to keep the ability of running only four jobs to get the polarizability tensor and the mean polarizability: you will have to add an argument \"order\" to the \\__init\\__ method and make sure it triggers to correct behaviour. You might therefore want to translate the workflow with 6 jobs to a new class deriving from AbstractWorkflow before actually modifying the ``PolTensor`` class. This should allow you to see which part of the code you have to modify, and to do it in a minimal fashion."
