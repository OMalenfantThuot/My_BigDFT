    "We will stick to the polarizability tensor problem, in order to build on what was achieved in the [previous exercise](https://mmoriniere.gitlab.io/MyBigDFT/notebooks/Solution_01.html).

You can use the same resources to help you, while the solution to this exercise can be found [here](https://mmoriniere.gitlab.io/MyBigDFT/notebooks/Solution_02.html)."

You will generally want to use it in order to create toy workflows, allowing you to easily experiment whether such workflows can be successfully implemented, without having to actually code a workflow class deriving from the ``AbstractWorkflow`` class (to be presented in the next exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of using this ``Workflow`` class is that it allows you to properly divide the workflow in a three-step process:\n",
    "- the definition of a list of jobs so as to initialize the workflow,\n",
    "- the sequential running of all the calculations defined in the first step,\n",
    "- the post-processing of of the calculations outputs, so as to extract the quantity of interest, here the polarizability tensor."

The main input parameters being given, you only have to add ``Job`` instances to the ``pt_queue`` list. You can do so by re-using the same jobs as in the previous notebook (especially the same electric fields and run directories): first, a ground state job (without electric field) and then three calculations with an electric field, along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axis respectively. Try to use a for loop to add the last three jobs to the queue.\n",
