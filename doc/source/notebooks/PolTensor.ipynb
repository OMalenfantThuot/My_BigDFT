    "\n",
    "MyBigDFT comes with some classes implementing particular workflows of calculations. These workflows define a queue of jobs, that can easily be run sequentially, without having to worry about the `Job` context manager. They also generally define a particular post-processing procedure, run after all the BigDFT calculations in order to extract some meaningful imformation.\n",

    "The example provided here shows how to obtain the polarizability tensor of the N$_2$ molecule by using the [PolTensor](https://mmoriniere.gitlab.io/MyBigDFT/poltensor.html) class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The polarizability tensor represents the response of the charges of a system (its dipole) to the application of an external electric field.\n",
    "To compute this polarizability tensor, some BigDFT calculations are performed, where the system is subject to an external electric field along each direction of space ($x$, $y$ and $z$). The elements of the polarizability tensor are then defined by the ratio of the delta of the dipole in one direction and the delta of the electric field amplitudes:\n",
    "$\\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\Delta D_i}{\\Delta E_j}$\n",
    "where $i, j \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$, $\\Delta D_i$ is the variation of the dipole along the $i$ direction and $\\Delta E_j$ is the variation of the electric field amplitude along the $j$ direction"

The values are consistent with what is reported in the litterature and the experiment (see Table II of [George Maroulis and Ajit J. Thakkar, *J. Chem. Phys.* **88**, 7623 (1988)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.454327)). Keep in mind that default input parameters were used, so that the the present calculations cannot be considered as converged.\n",

    "**Be carefull**: if the electric fields applied are high enough for some electrons to escape the system, then you cannot trust the results anymore. In such a case, the system you are trying to simulate is not the one you expected, because an occupied orbital has a positive energy under the perturbation of the elctric field. There is actually a rule of thumb to know if the electric field applied along a direction is not too high: the difference of potential along the electric field (*i.e.* the amplitude of the electric field times the length of the BigDFT grid along the direction of the electric field) has to be roughly two times smaller than the absolute value of the HOMO when there is no perturbation."
