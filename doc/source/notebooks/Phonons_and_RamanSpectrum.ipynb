    "# Compute the phonons and the Raman spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "MyBigDFT comes with some classes implementing particular workflows of calculations. These workflows define a queue of jobs, that can easily be run sequentially, without having to worry about the `Job` context manager. They also generally define a particular post-processing procedure, run after all the BigDFT calculations in order to extract some meaningful imformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example provided here shows how to obtain the phonons and the Raman spectrum of the N$_2$ molecule by using the [PolTensor](https://mmoriniere.gitlab.io/MyBigDFT/poltensor.html) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these calculations is to find the normal modes of vibration (or phonons) of the system under consideration as well as their intensities. A good reference for the underlying theory of molecular vibrations is the book *Molecular Vibrations* by Wilson *et al.* (1955) or the *Advances in Chemical Physics, vol. 67* by K.P. Lawley or *Spectra of Atoms and Molecules* by Peter F. Bernath (where the conversion between atomic units, SI units and the units used in the litterature is well explained in pages 316-317).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on how all these quantities are computed, you may read [A. Stirling, *J. Chem. Phys.* **104**, 1254 (1996)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.470783) and [D. Porezag and M. R.Pederson, *PRB* **54**, 7830-7836 (1996)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.54.7830). To check for the polarizability tensor and, more importantly, its derivative, we used [K. M. Gough *et al.*, *Can. J. Chem.* **74**, 1139-1144 (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1139/v96-128) as a comparison."

    "To get the **energies** of the Raman spectrum, one needs to find the **eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix**, that is closely related to the Hessian matrix. To build these matrices, one must find the derivatives of the forces when the position of each atom is translated (along each coordinate) by a small amount around their equilibrium position. To get a better precision on the derivative, each coodinate is translated positively and negatively. The number of BigDFT calculations therefore amounts to $2 * 3 n_{at} = 6 n_{at}$, where $n_{at}$ is the number of atoms (3 for the coordinates ($x$, $y$ and $z$), 2 for the number of calculations per coordinates).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be careful:** you must compute a geometry optimization of your system before actually computing the phonons, as you may get unphysical results. This part is not reproduced here. Similarly to the polarizability tensor calculation, you only need to provide a ground state job while default values are used to define the amplitude of the moves along each direction (you might want to set them via the `translation_amplitudes` argument).\n",

    "The nitrogen molecule being linear, it has $3 n_{at} - 5 = 1$ normal mode. Its energy, found using the LDA exchange-correlation is around 2390 cm$^{-1}$. Following the statement of [B. G. Johnson *et al.*, *J. Chem. Phys.* **98**, 5612 (1993)](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.464906), our result should be compared with the harmonic experimental value, which is reported to be 2360 cm$^{-1}$ in this same reference. There is a rather good agreement! Note that the actual experimental value (without neglecting anharmocity) is 2331 cm$^{-1}$.\n",
