    "You can run this new workflow. Note that a warning was raised, telling us that, at some point, the input wavefunctions had to be recalculated: this is because the forces found for the initial geometry were high. The geometry optimization procedure then had to move the atoms by a large amount, which was sufficient for the input wavefunctions to be recalculated for the second geometry. For that reason, it is better to start from an initial position that is already close to a minimum. You might want to reach that \"rather good\" initial geometry with low quality input parameters (such as a small grid extension and a large grid step) before performing a more expensive one which gives converged results with respect to those input parameters."
