Convergence classes
-------------------

This section focuses on the documentation of the convergence classes provided
by the MyBigDFT package. They are inteded to help the user define the value
of some basic BigDFT input parameters, for the BigDFT calculations to be
considered as converged with respect to those parameters (for a given
precision).
